"""gfx950 MLA decode for the Kimi-K3 DSpark draft group (ROCM_AITER_MLA).

The draft block is non-causal: every one of a request's ``query_len`` positions
attends to the same committed KV prefix. The Triton path expresses that by
flattening the block to one decode row per query token, which makes each row
re-read the whole KV span -- ``query_len`` times the traffic. This kernel keeps
the block folded into a single workgroup tile and reads the span once.

The kernel itself lives in aiter (``module_kimi_h40_draft``), which also owns
the split count, the row tile and the partial-accumulator workspace. Those were
duplicated here while the kernel was vendored into vLLM; keeping one copy means
the two cannot drift, and drift is not benign -- the workspace has to be sized
from the same block count the kernel derives, or the launch writes past it.

Everything below is therefore admission control: decide whether aiter can serve
this shape and return False if not. The checks have to be a superset of aiter's,
which raises rather than declines. AiterMLAMetadataBuilder screens the same
preconditions at startup, so a decline reaching it at runtime is a bug.
